Simple scripts for messing around
project2.py is supposed to ask for a whole number, check using a function if it is a number. If the input isn't the screen will turn red and inform the user that the input was invalid and to try again.

After wards the user is prompted for a multiplier and preforms the same check.

Finally the product is displayed on the screen.
